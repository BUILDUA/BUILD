Proposing and Contributing New UI Elements

As per our open source ethos, we welcome all contributions and proposals for new UI Elements for use in Project Norman.

However, it is not the sole responsiblity of the UxD team to create new UI Elements based on requests from other teams. It is rather 
their responsiblity to ensure consistancy and quality of UI elements throughout project Norman.

Therefore we request members of any Project Norman team who require a new UI element, or require and enhancment to an existing UI 
Element, to first design and execute the UI element, and subsequently submit pull requests for new UI Elements they have create or enhancments made to existing UI elements.

On receipt of the pull request, the UI element is submitted to a design review, and upon approval may be used.
