The Projec Norman Community Communication Guidelines are designed to make it clear that we believe in tolerance, respect, inclusion. 

The internet is full of codes of conduct, employee guidelines, community charters and then some. We’ve custom-written some bits of ours, but for a lot of this document is borrowed from people, companies and projects that have already done solid jobs at this very task (see our reference list below). No part of this is an endorsement of any of these people, companies or projects—simply us acknowledging that the specific language we’re referencing seems to mirror our own ideals and intentions.

General Values
We always try to...

Be open: We invite anybody, from any company or from no company, to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.
Be positive: There is so much more value in building people up than breaking them down. Even when we have to give an unpopular answer, we try to do so in a friendly and positive manner.
Be respectful: We work together to resolve conflict, placing facts before opinions. Heated debate is valuable and pushes everyone consider different points of view, but we don’t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack.
Be collaborative: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.
Be pragmatic: Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.
Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project or community, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the rest. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.
Take responsibility: We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.
Don't be a Dick
You shall be judged to have been a dick when a group of your peers have deemed that you were being a dick. If, after being warned, you continue to be a dick: you will be banned. There are no exceptions to this rule. Common examples of dickery include (but are not limited to):

Sexist, heterosexist, racist, or otherwise hateful remarks. Which are not tolerated under any circumstances. Swearing is fine, but never when directed at people.
Don't harass or bully people. Do not attempt to communicate with someone who has asked you to stop.
Don’t spam. Don’t make spammy posts, don’t post spammy replies, don’t send people spammy messages. Nobody likes spam. Nobody.
Don't impersonate or do things that would cause confusion between you and a person or company.
Don't do anything illegal. Don't screw with trademarks, copyrights, fraud or anything else that the police would not be happy to see you doing.
Conflicts of Interest
We expect leaders and community members to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and abstain from or delegate decisions that may be perceived as self-interested.

When in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favorable to the interests of one group over another.

Summary
These guidelines are not exhaustive or complete, nor are they a rulebook. They serve to express our common goals and sentiments for our community. We expect them to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter. We borrowed liberally from other projects with excellent guidelines:

Ember.js Community Guidelines
Mozilla Code of Conduct
Npm Code of Conduct
Tumblr Community Guidelines
Reporting Violations
If you feel that a member of the Ghost community is violating these guidelines, please report it immediately to report@ghost.org




##Project Norman Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are an important part of the Project Norman community. Every community uses mailing lists differently, so we recommed you spend some time understanding how to participate in a way that is acceptable to the community. Read the mailing list archives, observe for awhile first and be sure to inquire about and read any codes of conduct or guidelines before you post.

Please consider the following guidelines when using Project Norman open source mailing lists:

+ Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.

+ On matters of community conduct, the [project steering committe](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/wiki/Project-Norman-Project-Management) can make a final decision.

+ The policy of the Project Norman open source community is to to conduct as much discussion in public as possible, to encourage openness, provide a public record, and stimulate the broader community. However sometimes internal private mail lists are necessary. You should never divulge such information in public, or copy an email between private and public lists  without the permission of the mailing list members. 

+ Follow the mailing list posting style. For example, do people top or bottom post? Generally, the will be sound reasons for doing things a certain way.

+ Keep your posts  relevent to the topic. 

+ If you are re-posting a message, check the archives to see if it was already posted. Many mail clients don't send you duplicates of your mailing lists posts.

+ Don't post to multiple lists simultaneously. Take the time to understand the mailing lists and target your audience. 

+ Do not send community other members unsolicited personal messages. 

+  Avoid profanity. The cross-cultural nature of open source communities may expose you to serious misunderstandings.
 
+ Try to assume that other mailing list members are being positive, even if you suspect they are being negative.

+ If you are offended by a response or post, do not respond when you are angry.

+ Never post marketing messages, chain letters, marketing messages or spam.

+ Read the full thread before replying. 

+ Only post if you have exhausted all other reasonable options, such as checking the archives, searching documentation first, Google etc.

+ Never initiate or comment on religious or political discussions or arguments.
