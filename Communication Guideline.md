We endeavour to conduct as much discussion in public as possible. This encourages openness, provides a public record, and stimulates the broader community.

However sometimes internal private mail lists are necessary. You must never divulge such information in public without the express permission of the list. Also never copy an email between private and public lists (no Cc). Such an event would go beyond the normal need for email ettiquette and be a serious breach of confidence. It could have serious ramifications, cause unneccessary confusion and ill-informed discussion.


Mailing lists and web forums
Mailing lists are an important part of the Project Norman community. The code of conduct applies to your behaviour in those there aswell. Please follow these guidelines in addition to the general code of conduct:

+ Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.
+ Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments. On technical matters, our Module Owners can make a final decision. On matters of community conduct, the (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/wiki/Project-Norman-Project-Management) [project steering committe] can make a final decision.
