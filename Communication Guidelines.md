##Project Norman Issue Tracker

Each Norman sub-project has a unique Issue Tracker, which is used for all communication about issues and new features. For instructions on how to post an issue, see

We invite you to spend some time understanding how to participate in a way that is acceptable to the community. Read the Issue Tracker archives, observe for awhile first and be sure to inquire about and read any codes of conduct or guidelines before you post.

Please consider the following guidelines when using Project Norman Issue Trackers:

+ Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.

+ On matters of community conduct, the [project steering committe](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/wiki/Project-Norman-Project-Management) can make a final decision.

+ The policy of the Project Norman open source community is to to conduct as much discussion in public as possible, to encourage openness, provide a public record, and stimulate the broader community. However sometimes internal private conversations are necessary. You should never divulge such information in public, or copy an email between private and public lists  without the permission of the mailing list members. 

+ Follow the Issue Tracker posting style. For example, do people top or bottom post? Generally, the will be sound reasons for doing things a certain way.

+ Keep your posts  relevent to the topic. 

+ If you are re-posting a message, check the archives to see if it was already posted. Many mail clients don't send you duplicates of your mailing lists posts.

+ Don't post the same issue on multiple Issue Trackers simultaneously. Take the time to understand the mailing lists and target your audience. 

+ Do not send community other members unsolicited personal messages using the Issue Tracker.

+ Avoid profanity, even in jest. The cross-cultural nature of open source communities may expose you to serious misunderstandings.
 
+ Try to assume that other community members are being positive in their posts, even if you suspect they are being negative.

+ If you are offended by a response or post, do not respond when you are angry.

+ Never post marketing messages, chain letters, marketing messages or spam.

+ Read the full thread of an issue before replying. 

+ Only post if you have exhausted all other reasonable options, such as checking the archives, searching documentation first, Google etc.

+ Never initiate or comment on religious or political discussions or arguments.
