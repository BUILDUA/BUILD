##Community Guidelines
Consciously or unconsciously every open source community establishes their own unique sense of community and set of cultural norms. This document presents guidelines are designed enhance Project Noman community members' mutual respect and understanding to better enable us to work together towards our shared goals. 

Gnerally, you should consider these simple guidelines, and not rules (with excpetions marked *), and we hope that they will you collectively to  nurture an open, rewarding, and productive community. 

Some of these guidelines have been borrowed from the following open source initiatives, as they encapsulate what we believe are sound open-source community values:
+ [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/about/guidelines/)
+ [Ember.js Community Guidelines](http://emberjs.com/guidelines/) 
+ [Mozilla Code of Conduct](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Code_of_Conduct/Draft) 
+ [Npm Code of Conduct](https://github.com/npm/policies/blob/master/conduct.md) 
+ [Tumblr Community Guidelines](https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community) 

###Our Approach

We <i>encourage</i> you to do the following, and try and do the same ourselves:

+ <b>Be open</b>: We invite anybody, from any company or from no company, to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.

+ <b>Be positive</b>: There is so much more value in building people up than breaking them down. Even when we have to give an unpopular answer, we try to do so in a friendly and positive manner.

+ <b>Be respectful</b>: We work together to resolve conflict, placing facts before opinions. Heated debate is valuable and pushes 
everyone consider different points of view, but we donâ€™t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack.

+ <b>Be collaborative</b>: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

+ <b>Be pragmatic</b>: Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

+ <b>Step down considerately</b>: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project or community, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the rest. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

+ <b>Take responsibility</b>: We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.


We <i<demand</i> that you do the following, and do the same ourselves:

<b>Note</b> This is not an exhaustive list, but you get the idea. You will receive a warning from a community representative if you engage in any of these behaviors. If, after being warned, you continue, you will be banned. There are no exceptions to this rule.

+ * Refrain from sexist, heterosexist, racist, or otherwise hateful remarks. Which are not tolerated under any circumstances.

+ * Refrain from harassing or bulling people in any circumstance. Do not attempt to communicate with someone who has asked you to stop.

+ * Refrain from spamming. 

+ * Refrain from impersonating or do things that would cause confusion between you and a person or company.

+ * Refrain from doing anything illegal, and always take due consideration of  trademarks, copyrights, and anything else illegal.


### Conflicts of Interest
We expect leaders and community members to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and abstain from or delegate decisions that may be perceived as self-interested.

When in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or favorable to the interests of one group over another.

### Resolving Disputes

Each sub-project has a steering committee. One of their roles is to act as the ultimate arbiter in discussions between contributors that lead to disagreement and require mediation. Elevate rather than repeat yourselves. That's what they are there for.
