###<a name="Users"></a>Users

Without our users, Project Norman has no business purpose, and therefore their satisfaction is our goal. However, users' experience of creating apps for their businesses using Project Norman is also an invaluable source of user information for the Project Norman open source community. In addition, users police the work of open source community contributors by logging bug requests when they notice something isn't working as it should. Most current contributors are users who saw something in Project Norman that they wanted to be involved with, and started contributing.

###<a name="Contributors"></a>Contributors
