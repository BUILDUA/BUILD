###<a name="Users"></a>Users

Without our users, Project Norman has no business purpose, and therefore their satisfaction is our goal. However, users' experience of creating apps for their businesses using Project Norman is also an invaluable source of user information for the Project Norman open source community. In addition, users police the work of open source community contributors by logging bug requests when they notice something isn't working as it should. Most current contributors are users who saw something in Project Norman that they wanted to be involved with, and started contributing.

###<a name="Contributors"></a>Contributors

Describe contributor's roles and rights. Describe how they can become Committers  (or who they can become)

Describe development desirable skill levels (with suggestions for where they might be useful). The Apache approach is to point beginners to areas where the can begin working straight away, without have to learn much in advance, but also to make sure that the don't change anything that impacts an expert contributor negatively.

You can find out more about our current reviewers and contributors on the [Contributors] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md)  page.

###<a name="Reviewers"></a>Reviewers

Reviewers are generally experts in the environment to which the contribution applies, and are also Committers.The number of reviewers per project varies with the size of the project and the number of contribution.

On a daily basis, reviewers are responsible for:

+ Monitoring the Pull Request tab and reviewing all pull requests to ensure the code submitted conforms to the Norman coding guidelines and test requirements. In addition, in the case of bug fixes reviewers must ensure that the code is required solution in the up-to-date code base. In the case of new features or enhancements, the reviewer must ensure that it works according to agreed specifications. The review must also provide a timely reponse to the submitter.

+ Monitoring the Issue Tracker and triage incoming issues to ensure correct categorization and prioritization.

###<a name="Committers"></a>Committers

Committers are responsible for committing changes submitted by pull request and passed by a reviewer.
