## Guidelines for Reporting Bugs

We appreciate all efforts to notify us if something goes wrong. However, we have limited capacity, we give priority to bugs well-reported bugs. Following the guidelines below will ensure that your bug gets the highest priority from community developers.

<b>We do not accept proposal for new features through the Issue Tracker. They will be removed.</b>

Once you have acquainted yourself with the guidelines, you can go to project Issue Tracker to report the issue.


### Requirements for a bug report

Please conform you bug report to the following:
 1. **Only real bugs**: please do your best to make sure to only report real bugs. You should not report:
   * issues caused by application code or any code outside Project Norman.
   * issues that you cannot reproduce.
   * something that behaves just different from what you expected. A bug is when something behaves different than specified. When in doubt, ask in a forum.
   * requests for help in achieving a task in Project Norman. Please use a support forum like stackoverflow to request help.
   * feature requests. Features requests are removed from the project Issue Tracker automatically. For guidelines on contributing an enhancment, please refer to <a href="#Propose and Build New Features">    Propose and Build New Features</a> section.
 2. **No duplicate**: please search the issue tracker and make sure you bug has been reported previously.
 3. **Good summary**: please ensure the summary is specific to the issue.
 4. **Current bug**: the bug can be reproduced in the most current version. Please state the tested version!
 5. **Reproducible bug**: Please provide steps to reproduce the error, including:
   * a URL to access the example
   * any required user/password information. However, please ensure you don't reveal any proprietary security credentials.
   * detailed and complete step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug
 6. **Precise description**:
   * precisely state the expected and the actual behavior
   * give information about the used browser/device and its version, if possible also the behavior in other browsers/devices
   * if the bug is appears on a UI, please attach a screenshot with callouts describing the problem.
   * generally give as much additional information as possible. (But find the right balance: don not invest hours for a very obvious and easy to solve issue. When in doubt, give more information.)
 7. **Minimal example**: it is highly encouraged to provide a minimal example to reproduce.
 8. **Only one bug per report**: open different tickets for different issues

### Issue handling process

When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue, close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. Approved issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes.

An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed. The closing comment explains which patch version(s) will contain the fix.


### Usage of Labels

Github offers labels to categorize issues. This section will be updated when we have identified the labels we ar using for Project Norman.
