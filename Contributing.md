###<a name="Contribute Bug Reports, Analyses, or Fixes"></a>Contribute Bug Reports, Analyses, or Fixes
Check the Issue Tracker in the Project Norman sub-project repository you interested in contributing to. You might be able to provide further information, or a hint that helps other contributors understand the bug. This is a great way to get acquainted with the project. You might want to fix a bug. For more information, see <a href="#Fix Bugs">    Fix Bugs</a>.

You can contribute by simply reporting bugs you encountered when using Project Norman. Check the Issue Tracker in repository for the Project Norman sub-project for bugs you are interested in fixing. Consider issues that are currently being fixed aswell if they interest you, because the contributor responsible might appreciate the offer of assistance. 

For more comprehensive guidelines on reporting bugs, please refer to <a href="#How Do I Report Bugs?">    How Do I Report Bugs?</a> section.

You might identify and bugs you want to fix. Great! For guidelines on contributing a fix, please refer to <a href="#How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?">    How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?</a> section.

###<a name="Provide Miscellaneous Information"></a>Provide Miscellaneous Information

Inevitably, there is a wealth of information wihch the community would benefit from but that nobody has yet provided. We welcome contributions of all types of project-related information, such as test scenarios and results in various environments, performance tests and results, <i>How To</i>  or API documentation, and any other information you think the community will be able to use.

###<a name="Propose and Build New Features, Enhancements, and Optimizations"></a>Propose and Build New Features, Enhancements, and Optimizations

We welcome innovations and improvements to Project Norman, including contributions to documentation, examples or test cases, optimizations, new features and enhancments to existing features.

However, before you do any work beyond conceptual, we recommend you post an Issue with the label User Story on the Issue Tracker. When a core developer contacts you, discuss the proposed enhancement with them.

If you don't know exactly what you'd like to contribution, why not see if there is something on the in the Issue Tracker back log you find interesting. If you see something, why not give it a go? 


For guidelines on contributing a new feature or enhancement to existing features, please refer to <a href="#How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?">   How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?</a> section.

##<a name="How Do I Report Bugs?"></a> How Do I Report Bugs?

Bugs can be reported and tracked using the GitHub Issue Tracker for each sub-project.  To report a bug, you simply open the Issue Tracker in the sub-project, and click the <b>New Issue</b> button. 
For links to Issue Trackers for each of the Project Noman sub-project, see <a href="#Useful Links">    Useful Links</a>.

For information on proposing new features or enhancments, see <a href="#Propose and Build New Features, Enhancements, and Optimizations">    Propose and Build New Features, Enhancements, and Optimizations</a>.

Please review the guidelines below before submitting an bug. 

**Note**: These guidelines were adapted from the [SAP UI5 Open Source Contributing documentation](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Guidelines for a bug reports


We appreciate all efforts to notify us if something goes wrong. However, we have limited capacity, we give priority to bugs well-reported bugs. Following the guidelines below will ensure that your bug gets the highest priority from community developers.


Please conform you bug report to the following:
 1. **Only real bugs**: please do your best to make sure to only report real bugs. You should not report:
   * bugs caused by application code or any code outside Project Norman.
   * bugs that you cannot reproduce.
   * something that behaves just different from what you expected. A bug is when something behaves different than specified. When in doubt, ask in a forum.
   * requests for help in achieving a task in Project Norman. Please use a support forum like stackoverflow to request help.
   * feature requests. Features requests are removed from the project Issue Tracker automatically. For information on proposing new features or enhancments, see the [Contribution](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/dev/Contribution.md) document.
 2. **No duplicates**: please search the Issue Tracker and make sure you bug has been reported previously.
 3. **Good summary**: please ensure the summary is specific to the bug.
 4. **Current bug**: the bug can be reproduced in the most current version. Please state the tested version!
 5. **Reproducible bug**: Please provide steps to reproduce the error, including:
   * a URL to access the example
   * any required user/password information. However, please ensure you don't reveal any proprietary security credentials.
   * detailed and complete step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug
 6. **Precise description**:
   * precisely state the expected and the actual behavior
   * give information about the used browser/device and its version, if possible also the behavior in other browsers/devices
   * if the bug is appears on a UI, please attach a screenshot with callouts describing the problem.
   * generally give as much additional information as possible. (But find the right balance: don not invest hours for a very obvious and easy to solve bug. When in doubt, give more information.)
 7. **Minimal example**: it is highly encouraged to provide a minimal example to reproduce.
 8. **Only one bug per report**: open different tickets for different bugs


You are encouraged to use [this template](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/bug_report_template.md).

Please report bugs in English, so all users can understand them.


### Quick Checklist for Bug Reports

 * Bug report checklist:
 * Real, current bug
 * No duplicate
 * Reproducible
 * Good summary
 * Well-documented
 * Minimal example
 * Use the [template](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/bug_report_template.md)


### Bug handling process

When a bug is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real bug, close it if it is not an bug, or ask for more details. Approved bugs are either assigned to a committer in GitHub or added to the backlog for future resolution. All bugs remain open until they are fixed.

A bug that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed. The closing comment explains which version(s) contain the fix.

##<a name="How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?"></a>How Do I Make Changes to Product Norman Sub-Projects?

You submit changes to Project Norman sub-projects, such as bug fixes and new or improved features, using pull requests to the relevant sub-project repository. However, we do not accept all pull requests, and those we accept have to meet specific standards. Therefore, prior to coding changes, to ensure that you are spending your time wisely, we recommend you propose and disuss your new feature or significant bug fix with on of our core developers using the Issue Tracker for the Norman sub-project you want to contribute to. When a core developer responds, discuss the proposed enhancement with them. Once this discussion yields a shared consensus, you can confidently proceed and create the code. Furthermore, the developer might have some valuable hints and tips that save you a lot of time of and effort.

**Note**:  For more information on Project Norman mailing lists, see our [Communications Guidelines](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Communication%20Guidelines.md).

**Note**:  For more information on the roles of contributors, committers, reviews, and project steering committe, see the  [Community Roles](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Community Roles.md).

###<a name="Changing Code and Submitting Your Changes"></a>Changing Code and Submitting Your Changes

Use the following procedure to change code and submit your changes:

**1.**   Review the [Apache License] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/License.txt) (which describes contributions) which outlines both your and the Project Norman Open Source Community's legal rights regarding your contribution.

**2.**  Download, read, sign, and send us our [Individual Contribution License Agreement] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/docs/SAP%20Individual%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) if you want to submit code as an individual. Alternatively, if you want to submit code on behalf of your employer, a company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/docs/SAP%20Corporate%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) form.  

**3.**   Fork the sub-project repo. For more information, see [Fork a Repo] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

**4.**   Install the required dependancies and tools. 

**5.**   Implement your new feature or bug fix on your branch, taking the following into consideration:

<ul>
<li>Base all your work off of the <b>master<b/> branch. </li>
<li>Please name your branch to match the new feature of bug fix that you are submitting.</li>
<li>Please do not submit more than one feature or bug fix per pull request.</li>
<li>For consistency, and to enhance the chances that your contribution will be passed for review without corrections required, please read the <a href="https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Project%20Norman%20Style%20Guide.md">Project Norman Style Guide</a> to ensure that your code conforms to our current approach.</li>
<li>Be sure your author field in Git is filled out correctly, including full name and email address. This enables us to credit you for your contribution.</li>
</ul>

**6.**   Perform the requisite pre-pull request testing procedures. Please include tests to prove your code works. 

**7.**  Push the changes on your fork,  and submit pull request for original repository. Fore more information, see [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

**Note**:  For guidelines on commit messages, see the [Project Norman Style Guide](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Project%20Norman%20Style%20Guide.md).


**8.**   When you have submitted a pull request, a reviewer on the project team reviews your contribution to evaluate whether it can be committed to the master copy of the project, whether further discussion and development for further consideration, or whether it is not accepted as a contribution. It is generally expected that some communication is required with contributors after they have submitted a pull request, and quite rare that a contribution is accepted without qualification on the first attempt.
