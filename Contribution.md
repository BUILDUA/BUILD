###<a name="Propose and Build New Features"></a>Propose and Build New Features

We welcome your innovations to Project Norman. If you don't know exactly what you'd like to contribution, why not see if there is something on the project roadmap you find interesting. If you see something, why not give it a go? Contact one of our core developers first though, to make sure nobody else has started it. Even if they have, you might still be able to contribute. In any case, contacting the developer and agreeing on the basic parameters of your proposal is an important if you don't want to risk your contribution being refused. Furthermore, the developer might have some valuable hints and tips that save you a lot of time of and effort. 

For guidelines on reporting issues, please refer to <a href="#How Do I Contribute Code?">    How Do I Contribute Code?</a> section.


##<a name="How Do I Report Issues?"></a>How Do I Report Issues?

Describe the process for reporting issues / How to use issues in Git Hub; how labels are used; how issues are named etc.

Search the [Project Norman GitHub Issue Tracker] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/issues) to make sure the bug has not yet been reported, or that your proposed enhancement hasn't already been started. Once you're certain nobody else is working on your proposed change or fix, you can contact our development team for a quick chat, and maybe we can give you some pointers before you start. You can get their contact details [here](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md).


##<a name="How Do I Contribute Code?"></a>How Do I Contribute Code?

Most likely, you want to contribute code to fix an existing bug, enhancement an existing feature, or add a new feature. This section describes how to do the following: (This list should be cross-applicable for both fixes and enhancements (with special mention to ensure that they have reviewed the earlier sections referring to making sure they've checked whether its been done, are familiar with guidelines etc.)


1. Search the issue tracker to make sure the bug has not yet been reported, or that your proposed enhancement hasn't already been started by somebody else. 
 
2. Contact our development team for a quick chat. While we deeply appreciate your efforts, we do not accept and support all new features or bug fixes submitted by contributors.  Use the DL for the project,  or the project blog, to contact a member of the core development team and describe your idea before you start. The developer may agree to support your new feature, in which case he can probably provide you with some valuable advice, or recommendations for modifications. In cases where the developer does not support your new feature, she can provide you with an explanation, and perhaps recommend an alternative.
 
**       We do not accept proposal for new features through the Issue Tracker. They will be removed.**

3. Review the [Apache License] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/License.txt) (which describes contributions) which outlines both your and the Project Norman Open Source Community's legal rights regarding your contribution.

4. Download, read, sign, and send us our [Individual Contribution License Agreement] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/docs/SAP%20Individual%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) if you want to submit code as an individual. Alternatively, if you want to submit code on behalf of your employer, a company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/docs/SAP%20Corporate%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) form.  

5. Download the GiTHub Repository for the project. (link to instructions on how to)

6. Install the required tools. (link to suitable documents in wiki)
 
7. Implement your new feature or bug fix on your branch. For consistency, and to enhance the chances that your contribution will be passed for review without corrections required, please review our coding guidelines to ensure that your code conforms to our current approach. (link to coding guidelines)

8. Perform the requisite pre-pull request testing procedures (link to description of these in the wiki - overlap with guidelines)

9. Make a pull request, and wait for a response from the project team reviewer or committer for the area to which your bug fix or enhancment applies. 


###<a name="What are the Project Norman Development Guidelines?"></a>What are the Project Norman Development Guidelines?
Integrate this with the above (i.e. what are the things that need to be provide for 1. a bug fix; 2. a new feature) - in a sense, what to do before (see above), and then the adherence to guidelines are two sepearate processes.

Abstract definition of the languages, styles, quality issues (they can impact whether the contribution is adopted and integrated - this should also be stressed in earlier section, along with the warning that not all pull requests are accepted). Include links to specific wiki pages, where this information is stored.



1. Base all your work off of the devel branch. The devel branch is where active development happens. We do not merge patches directly into master.

2. Name your branch to match the new feature of bug fix that you are submitting.

3. Limit yourself to one feature or bug fix per pull request.

4. Include tests that prove your code works.

5. Follow the MDG style guide for code and commit messages.

Be sure your author field in git is properly filled out with your full name and email address so we can credit you.



##<a name="Who Contributes to Project Norman Projects?"></a>Who Contributes to Project Norman Projects?

The Project Norman Open Source community comprises the following roles:

+ <a href="#Users">Users</a>


+ <a href="#Contributors">Contributors</a>


+ <a href="#Committers">Comitters</a>


+ <a href="#Reviewers">Reviewers</a>


+ <a href="#Public Management Committee Member">Public Management Committee </a>


###<a name="Users"></a>Users

Without our users, Project Norman has no business purpose, and therefore their satisfaction is our goal. However, users' experience of creating apps for their businesses using Project Norman is also an invaluable source of user information for the Project Norman open source community. In addition, users police the work of open source community contributors by logging bug requests when they notice something isn't working as it should. Most current contributors are users who saw something in Project Norman that they wanted to be involved with, and started contributing.

###<a name="Contributors"></a>Contributors

Describe contributor's roles and rights. Describe how they can become Committers  (or who they can become)

Describe development desirable skill levels (with suggestions for where they might be useful). The Apache approach is to point beginners to areas where the can begin working straight away, without have to learn much in advance, but also to make sure that the don't change anything that impacts an expert contributor negatively.

You can find out more about our current reviewers and contributors on the [Contributors] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md)  page.

###<a name="Reviewers"></a>Reviewers

Reviewers are responsible for reviewing all code and documentation submissions to projects. Reviewers are respsible for ensuring that submissions meet the agreed requirments in terms of scope, code-quality, and functionality. In order to optimize the chances for your submissions to pass the review stage, we recommend you review the submission guidelines (link) and code guidelines (link.)

The number of reviewers per project varies with the size of the project and the number of contribution.

Established contributors in a project can be enabled as reviewers for that project if they receive the support of the project steering committee. It can be useful to be a committer. 

You can find out more about our current reviewers and contributors on the [Contributors] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md)  page.

When you have submitted a pull request, a qualified review on the project team reviews your contribution to evaluate whether it can be committed to the master copy of the project, whether further discussion and development for further consideration, or whether it is not accepted as a contribution. It is generally expected that some communication is required with contributors after they have submitted a pull request, and quite rare that a contribution is accepted without qualification on the first attempt.

Reviewers are generally experts in the environment to which the contribution applies, and are also Committers.

Outline terms of how these decisions are made, how contributions are recognized/rewarded, how conflicts are resolved, how a lazy consensus is a useful tool, how features that have been agreed upon earlier, and that conform to coding guidelines, have a dramatically improved chance of being accepted straight away. 




###<a name="Committers"></a>Committers

Committers are responsible for commiting changes submitted by pull request and passed by a reviewer.


Established contributors in a project can be enabled as reviewers for that project if they receive the support of the project steering committee. It can be useful to be a committer. For example, providing support for Project Norman to a customer, being a committer could be a big selling poin of their skills for the customer.  

You can find out more about our current reviewers and contributors on the [Contributors] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md)  page.


###<a name="Project Steering Committee"></a>Public Management Committee

Each project is run on day to day basis by the contributors, and operates under the guidance of a dedicated Project Steering Committee. Project Steering Committees are responsible for providing oversight of project developments, securing and organizing resources, removing obtacles, and resolving conflicts. Each Project Steering Committee, in turn, operates under the guidance of the Project Norman Steering Committee. For more information on the composition and roles of these steering committees, and the Project Norman project structure, see [Project Norman Project Managment](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/wiki/Project-Norman-Project-Management).
