###<a name="Users"></a>Users

Without our users, Project Norman has no business purpose, and therefore their satisfaction is our goal. However, users' experience of creating apps for their businesses using Project Norman is also an invaluable source of user information for the Project Norman open source community. In addition, users police the work of open source community contributors by logging bug requests when they notice something isn't working as it should. Most current contributors are users who saw something in Project Norman that they wanted to be involved with, and started contributing.

###<a name="Contributors"></a>Contributors

Describe contributor's roles and rights. Describe how they can become Committers  (or who they can become)

Describe development desirable skill levels (with suggestions for where they might be useful). The Apache approach is to point beginners to areas where the can begin working straight away, without have to learn much in advance, but also to make sure that the don't change anything that impacts an expert contributor negatively.

You can find out more about our current reviewers and contributors on the [Contributors] (https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Drive/blob/master/Contributors.md)  page.

###<a name="Reviewers"></a>Reviewers

Reviewers are responsible for reviewing all code and documentation submissions to projects. Reviewers are respsible for ensuring that submissions meet the agreed requirments in terms of scope, code-quality, and functionality. In order to optimize the chances for your submissions to pass the review stage, we recommend you review the submission guidelines (link) and code guidelines (link.)

The number of reviewers per project varies with the size of the project and the number of contribution.

Established contributors in a project can be enabled as reviewers for that project if they receive the support of the project steering committee. It can be useful to be a committer.

1. Search the issue tracker to make sure the bug has not yet been reported, or that your proposed enhancement hasn't already been started by somebody else. 
 
2. Contact our development team for a quick chat. While we deeply appreciate your efforts, we do not accept and support all new features or bug fixes submitted by contributors. Therefore, in order to optimize the chances of your change being accepted,  contact a member of the core development team, using the DL for the project or the project blog, and describe your idea before you start. The developer may agree to support your new feature, in which case he can probably provide you with some valuable advice, or recommendations for modifications. In cases where the developer does not support your new feature, she can provide you with an explanation, and perhaps recommend an alternative.
 
**We do not accept proposal for new features through the Issue Tracker. They will be removed.**
