###<a name="Users"></a>Users

Without our users, Project Norman has no business purpose, and therefore their satisfaction is our goal. However, users' experience of creating apps for their businesses using Project Norman is also an invaluable source of user information for the Project Norman open source community. In addition, users police the work of open source community contributors by logging bug requests when they notice something isn't working as it should. Most current contributors are users who saw something in Project Norman that they wanted to be involved with, and started contributing.

###<a name="Contributors"></a>Contributors

Describe contributor's roles and rights. Describe how they can become Committers  (or who they can become)

Describe development desirable skill levels (with suggestions for where they might be useful). The Apache approach is to point beginners to areas where the can begin working straight away, without have to learn much in advance, but also to make sure that the don't change anything that impacts an expert contributor negatively.

###<a name="Reviewers"></a>Reviewers

Reviewers are responsible for ensuring all code and documentation submissions to Project Norman sub-projects meet the agreed requirements in terms of scope, code-quality, and functionality. Reviewers are generally experts in the environment to which the contribution applies, and are also Committers.

When you have submitted a pull request, a reviewer on the project team reviews your contribution to evaluate whether it can be committed to the master copy of the project, whether further discussion and development for further consideration, or whether it is not accepted as a contribution. It is generally expected that some communication is required with contributors after they have submitted a pull request, and quite rare that a contribution is accepted without qualification on the first attempt.
The number of reviewers per project varies with the size of the project and the number of contribution.

**Note**:  In order to optimize the chances for your submissions to pass the review stage, we recommend you review  [Project Norman Guidelines](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Project%20Norman%20Style%20Guide.md).

###<a name="Committers"></a>Committers

Committers are responsible for committing changes submitted by pull request and passed by a reviewer.

Established contributors in a project can be enabled as reviewers for that project if they receive the support of the project steering committee. It can be useful to be a committer. For example, providing support for Project Norman to a customer, being a committer could be a big selling poin of their skills for the customer.

###<a name="Project Steering Committee"></a>Public Management Committee

Each project is run on day to day basis by the contributors, and operates under the guidance of a dedicated Project Steering Committee. Project Steering Committees are responsible for providing oversight of project developments, securing and organizing resources, removing obtacles, and resolving conflicts. Each Project Steering Committee, in turn, operates under the guidance of the Project Norman Steering Committee. For more information on the composition and roles of these steering committees, and the Project Norman project structure, see [Project Norman Project Management](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/wiki/Project-Norman-Project-Management).
