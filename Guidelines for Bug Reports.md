###<a name="Guidelines for Bug Reports"></a> Guidelines for Bug Reports

We appreciate all efforts to notify us if something goes wrong. However, we have limited capacity, we give priority to bugs well-reported bugs. Following the guidelines below will ensure that your bug gets the highest priority from community developers.

Please conform you bug report to the following:
 1. **Only real bugs**: please do your best to make sure to only report real bugs. You should not report:
   * bugs caused by application code or any code outside Project Norman.
   * bugs that you cannot reproduce.
   * something that behaves just different from what you expected. A bug is when something behaves different than specified. When in doubt, ask in a forum.
   * requests for help in achieving a task in Project Norman. Please use a support forum like stackoverflow to request help.
   * feature requests. Features requests are removed from the project Issue Tracker automatically. For information on proposing new features or enhancments, see the [Contribution](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/Norman/Norman/blob/master/Contributing.md) document.
 2. **No duplicates**: please search the Issue Tracker and make sure you bug has been reported previously.
 3. **Title**: please make sure the title reflects the issue, so that at a glance the community can identify whether it may be relevant to them. For example, if reporting that a feature on the Projects UI is displaying incorrectly, use 'Display issue with Projects UI', rather than 'UI Issue'. In addition, if the issue is related to a particular backlog item, please include the backlog issue number in the title.
 4. **Good summary**: please ensure the summary is specific to the bug.
 5. **Current bug**: the bug can be reproduced in the most current version. Please state the tested version!
 6. **Reproducible bug**: Please provide steps to reproduce the error, including:
   * a URL to access the example
   * any required user/password information. However, please ensure you don't reveal any proprietary security credentials.
   * detailed and complete step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug
 7. **Precise description**:
   * precisely state the expected and the actual behavior
   * give information about the used browser/device and its version, if possible also the behavior in other browsers/devices
   * if the bug is appears on a UI, please attach a screenshot with callouts describing the problem.
   * generally give as much additional information as possible. (But find the right balance: don not invest hours for a very obvious and easy to solve bug. When in doubt, give more information.)
 8. **Minimal example**: it is highly encouraged to provide a minimal example to reproduce.
 9. **Only one bug per report**: open different tickets for different bugs
