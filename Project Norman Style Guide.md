###Commit messages

Please consider the following guidelines when writing a commit message:

+ The first line should be a summary of the change.
+ Imperative messages are effective. For example, "Add KPI to monitor performance" is better than "Performance KPIs" or "Added KPIs so that we can monitor performance"
+ In order to ensure the the GitHub command line output is readable, the first line of a commit message should contain a maximum of 50 characters. 
+ Subsequent lines, if any, can be more detailed.
