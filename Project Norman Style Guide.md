These guidelines are designed to help you to write clear, organized, high-quality code that is consistent with the code in Project Norman. All code in pull requests to Project Norman should follow these rules. 

###Commit messages

Please consider the following guidelines when writing a commit message:

+ The title of the message should reference the issue number from the Issue Tracker that the pull request relates to. For example, the title for a pull-request for issue number 20 should be in the format [<i>Message Title</i>][<i>Issus #20</i>]
+ The title should be a summary of the change.
+ Imperative titles are effective. For example, "Add KPI to monitor performance" is better than "Performance KPIs" or "Added KPIs so that we can monitor performance"
+ In order to ensure the the GitHub command line output is readable, the first line of a commit message should contain a maximum of 50 characters. 
+ Subsequent lines, if any, can be more detailed.
